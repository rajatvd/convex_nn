`convex_nn`: a Python packing for learning with convex neural networks.

There are two public modules:
    1. `convex_nn.f`  - a simple functional interface for training models.
    2. `convex_nn.oo` - an objective oriented interface that provides additional flexibility in model specification and training.

Internal model representations and optimization procedures are located in `convex_nn.private`.
